####Note on project
I had a tough time reconciling the "header/h1" and new "nav" tag. I wanted both of these object in-line, and I wanted to keep using floats in order to achinve that, but I was having a harder time than expected. I'll keep plugging away, and apart from going back to the lection for an explanation -- any advice would be much (very much appreciated)

Thanks!
